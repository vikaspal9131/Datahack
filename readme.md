Objective:
Design and develop an MLOps pipeline to process raw sales and inventory data from independent restaurants, providing actionable insights, issue detection, and recommendations. Each restaurant has unique data structures, requiring a scalable and flexible pipeline.

Key Features:
Automated Data Ingestion and Transformation

Automate ETL using Apache Airflow or AWS Glue.
Normalize varied data structures for unified analysis.
Store data in AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
Intelligent Issue Detection & Recommendations

Detect anomalies (e.g., suspicious transactions, theft) using models like Isolation Forests.
Provide a rating system (1-5 or color-coded) to flag severity.
Visualize insights with Dash or Tableau.
Multi-Calendar Predictions

Implement time-series models (Prophet, ARIMA) for diverse calendars.
Customize forecasts for specific restaurant timelines and holidays.
Continuous Feedback Loop

Collect user feedback on suggestions to improve models via reinforcement learning.
Bonus Features:
Analyze historical data for trends and predictions using advanced time-series models.
Use NLP for prompt-based dashboards via Power BI or Looker.

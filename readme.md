Objective(Intro):
Design and develop an MLOps pipeline to handle raw sales and inventory data from independent restaurants and provide actionable insights, problem identification, and suggestions, design and create an MLOps pipeline. A scalable and adaptable pipeline is necessary because every restaurant has different data structures.


Key Features:

Automated Data Ingestion and Transformation:
Streamline ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using tools like Apache Airflow or AWS Glue.Normalize diverse data structures into a unified format for consistent analysis.Store processed data in scalable cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

Intelligent Issue Detection and Recommendations:
Detect anomalies (e.g., suspicious transactions, inventory theft) using advanced machine learning models like Isolation Forests.Implement a severity rating system (e.g., 1-5 scale or color-coded alerts) to prioritize issues.Visualize insights and anomalies through interactive dashboards using tools like Dash or Tableau.

Multi-Calendar Predictions:
Leverage time-series forecasting models such as Prophet or ARIMA to accommodate diverse calendar systems (e.g., fiscal, lunar, or regional calendars).Customize predictions to align with specific restaurant timelines, seasonal trends, and holidays.

Continuous Feedback Loop:
Collect user feedback on system-generated recommendations to refine and improve models.
Incorporate reinforcement learning techniques to iteratively enhance model accuracy and relevance.

Bonus Features:
Perform advanced time-series analysis on historical data to identify trends and generate predictive insights.Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable prompt-based dashboard interactions and queries via platforms like Power BI or Looker.
